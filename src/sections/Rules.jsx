          You first have to determine the teeing order (your choice on the
          method). This order doesnâ€™t change. Player A always follows B, and C
          always follows B, etc...
        </p>
        <p>
          The Wolf tees off first, and the role of wolf rotates every hole. So
          if player A is the first wolf, B is second, C is third, and so on.
          However, on the 17th and 18th holes, the players that are behind in
          points are allowed to be Wolf.
