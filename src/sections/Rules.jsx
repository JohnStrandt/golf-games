        <p className="mb-2">
          You first have to determine the teeing order (your choice on the
          method). This order doesnâ€™t change. Player-2 always follows Player-1,
          and 3 always follows 2, etc...
          <br />
          The role of wolf rotates on each consecutive hole, and the wolf always
          has the honors. So if Player-1 is the wolf on the first hole, 2 hits
          second, 3 hits third, etc... On the next tee, Player-2 is now the wolf
          and hits first, 3 hits second, 4 third, and so on...
          <br />
          However, on the 17th and 18th holes, the players that are behind in
          points are allowed to be Wolf. Always maintaining the same hitting
          order.
          <br />
          In the app, the players are always listed in the correct teeing order
          at the start of each hole.

                After one player hits their tee shot, the Wolf needs to decide
                if they want them as a partner before the next player hits their
                tee shot.

                You may decide not to implement this rule as it can be brutal.
