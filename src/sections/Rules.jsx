        <h2 className="text-lg mb-2">Order of Play</h2>
        <p className="mb-2">
          You first have to determine the teeing order (your choice on the
          method). This order doesnâ€™t change. Player A always follows B, and C
          always follows B, etc...
        </p>
        <p>
          The role of wolf rotates on each consecutive hole, and the wolf always
          has the honors. So if player A is the wolf on the first hole, B hits
          second, C hits third, etc... On the next tee, player B is now the wolf
          and hits first, C hits second, D third, and so on... However, on the
          17th and 18th holes, the players that are behind in points are allowed
          to be Wolf. Always maintaining the same hitting order.

          <h2 className="text-lg mb-2">Wolf Selects Partner</h2>
          <p>
            The wolf can choose to go it alone at any point of the tee sequence.
            Either before he hits after he hits, or after everyone hits.
            Doesn&apos;t matter. However, if you want to choose a playing
            partner, you need to do so before the next player hits their tee
            shot.
