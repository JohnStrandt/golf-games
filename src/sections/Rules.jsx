          You first have to determine the teeing order (your choice on the
          method). This order doesnâ€™t change. The role of wolf rotates on each
          hole, and the wolf always has the honors.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className="font-semibold">Holes 17 and 18: </span>Everyone has
          been wolf four times and there are two holes left. The player in last
          place is made the wolf on the following hole. If there is a tie for
          last place, a random (last place) player is chosen as wolf. So pay
          attention!
        </p>
        <p>
          The app always displays the correct teeing order when players are on
          the tee box and the wolf is choosing to partner or go solo.
