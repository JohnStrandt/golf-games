          You first have to determine the teeing order (your choice on the
          method). This order doesnâ€™t change. The role of wolf rotates on each
          hole, and the wolf always has the honors.
          <br />
          <br />
          <span className="font-bold">Holes 17 and 18: </span>Everyone has been
          wolf four times and there are two holes left. The players that are
          behind in points become the wolf.
          <br />
          <br />
          The app always displays the correct teeing order when players are on
          the tee box and the wolf is choosing on partner.

                After one player hits their tee shot, the Wolf needs to decide
                if they want them as a partner before the next player hits their
                tee shot.

                Can be called at any time on the tee box.
